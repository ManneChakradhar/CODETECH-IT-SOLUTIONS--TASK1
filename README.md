# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-EDA-
This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python Pandas. The project analyses marathon race data sourced from Kaggle, utilizing Jupyter Notebook for coding.
EDA is a significant step before diving into statistical modelling or machine learning, to ensure the data is what it is claimed to be and that there are no obvious errors.


# Overview
 Typical Process:
 Look at the Data, Clean the Data, Make Summaries, Visualize the Data, Ask Questions and Find Answers.
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in data analysis. It involves analyzing and visualizing data to understand its main 
 characteristics, uncover patterns, and identify relationships between variables.
 This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python tools and libraries within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

 # Dataset
 This dataset contains sales data for a retail store during the Diwali festival period in India. The data includes information on the user_id, customer name, 
 Product ID, Gender, Age Group, Age, Marital status, state, Zone, Occupation, Product Category, Orders, Amount, Status. The dataset file i.e.,CSV file is provided 
 in this repository.

 # Installation
 ## Tools and Libraries: 
 ##Python: Python is the primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis. 
 ##Jupyter Notebook: Provides an interactive environment for running Python code and documenting the analysis process. 
 ##Libraries: Key libraries such as Pandas (for data manipulation), Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization), and NumPy (for numerical operations) are 
 utilized.

 # Exploratory Data Analysis
 Loading Data: Load the dataset into the notebook using Pandas, and examine its structure (columns, data types, missing values).
 Data Cleaning: Perform necessary cleaning operations such as handling missing values, dealing with duplicates, and ensuring data consistency. Exploratory 
 Analysis: EDA using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, ensuring clarity and completeness in documenting the analysis process.
 Summary Statistics: Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, etc.) to understand the central tendencies and spread of data.
 Data Visualization: Use visualizations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to identify patterns, trends, outliers, and relationships between variables.
 Correlation Analysis: Explore correlations between variables to understand which factors influence each other and how.

 # Results and Findings
 Through EDA, we got useful insights
 From the Gender column, we got that most of the buyers are females and even the purchasing power of females are greater than men.
 From the Age column, we can see that most of the buyers are of the age group between 26-35 yrs female.
 From the State column, we can see that most of the orders & total sales/amount are from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi respectively.
 From the marital status column we can see that most of the buyers are married (women) and they have high purchasing power.
 From the Occupation we can see that most of the buyers are working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation sector.
 From the Product Category, we can see that most of the sold products are from the Food, Clothing and Electronics category.

 # Conclusion
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial for understanding datasets, identifying patterns, and informing subsequent analysis. Data pre-processing and feature 
 engineering are essential steps in preparing data for analysis, involving tasks such as data reduction, cleaning, and transformation. Python libraries offer 
 powerful tools for executing these steps efficiently. Also, in the article we talk about how eda uses Python and how you can make it we showed a complete guide 
 for that.

 Data Analysis helps to find the basic structure of the dataset.
- Dropped columns that are not adding value to our analysis.
- Performed Feature Engineering by adding some columns which contribute to our analysis.
- Data Transformations have been used to normalize the columns.

In Conclusion, Married women in the age group 26-35 years from UP, Maharastra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics categories.
