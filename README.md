# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-EDA-
This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python Pandas. The project analyses marathon race data sourced from Kaggle, utilizing Jupyter Notebook for coding.
EDA is a significant step before diving into statistical modelling or machine learning, to ensure the data is what it is claimed to be and that there are no obvious errors.

# Overview
 Typical Process:
 Look at the Data, Clean the Data, Make Summaries, Visualize the Data, Ask Questions and Find Answers.
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in the data analysis process. It involves analyzing and visualizing data to understand its main 
 characteristics, uncover patterns, and identify relationships between variables.
 The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python tools and libraries within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

 #Dataset
 This dataset contains sales data for a retail store during the Diwali festival period in India. The data includes information on the user_id, customer name, 
 Product ID, Gender, Age Group, Age, Marital status, state, Zone, Occupation, Product Category, Orders, Amount, Status. The dataset file i.e.,CSV file is provided 
 in this repository.

 #Installation
 ##Tools and Libraries: 
 ##Python: Python is the primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis. 
 ##Jupyter Notebook: Provides an interactive environment for running Python code and documenting the analysis process. 
 ##Libraries: Key libraries such as Pandas (for data manipulation), Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization), and NumPy (for numerical operations) are 
 utilized.

 #Exploratory Data Analysis
 Loading Data: Load the dataset into the notebook using Pandas, and examine its structure (columns, data types, missing values).
 Data Cleaning: Perform necessary cleaning operations such as handling missing values, dealing with duplicates, and ensuring data consistency. Exploratory 
 Analysis: EDA using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, ensuring clarity and completeness in documenting the analysis process.
 Summary Statistics: Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, etc.) to understand the central tendencies and spread of data.
 Data Visualization: Use visualizations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to identify patterns, trends, outliers, and relationships between variables.
 Correlation Analysis: Explore correlations between variables to understand which factors influence each other and how.
